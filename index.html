                    If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. 
                    There's no way around these two things that I'm aware of, no shortcut.

                      intuition about that territory... you learn many properties that are true and many properties
                      that are false. Eventually your brain will have learned how to take larger and larger steps.
                      And <strong>shazam</strong>, you’ll be ready to take some giant steps and solve the big problem."

          That is, simply, the question. Certain
          <a href="https://julian.com">blogs</a> are very well written. Others,
          not so <a href="https://sinakhalili.com/blog.html">much.</a> How
          should one decide whether something is worth blogging about?

                Even if nobody reads them, you should write them. 
                It's become pretty clear to me that blogging is a source of both innovation and clarity. 
                I have many of my best ideas and insights while blogging. 
                Struggling to express things that you're thinking or feeling helps you understand them better.

            <span class="newthought">With more tools</span> at our disposal, are we any more productive?
            I think that depends if the tools offer us some fundamentally new mental model of looking at
            information. For example, I don't think Evernote or Google Keep are more productive. They are
            simply the note-taking concept. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But emacs' <code>org-mode</code> presents a new way to approach
            notes: from within your programming environmnet. Giving us access to things like <code>babel</code>.

          Often, when reading or learning, the accumulation of energy will be so much such that I cannot sit still. I must move.
          I must write or tell someone or walk around saying "Gee whiz!". This might be because I'm extremely prone to daydreaming,
          but also because ideas really <em>are</em> that powerful 
          <label for="sn-powerful-idea" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="sn-powerful-idea" class="margin-toggle">
          <span class="sidenote">In fact, ideas are perhaps the <em>most</em> powerful creations of humankind</span>
          . In this behaviour, at least I am not <a href="https://twitter.com/rjs/status/1286736308686041089">alone</a>.

          That is the main reason I'd like to create this blog. So that these complex ideas don't stay in this brain, because my brain
          has historically been a poor place for storage.

          It's easy to over-judge yourself. So I'm going to just be okay with putting garbage out there.
          Boggedy boogedy boogedy booooooooo. Alright, enough silly talk. Actually, just kidding, there's never
          enough silly talk. I silly talk all the time. I'm silly talking now. I'll silly talk tomorrow. In fact, rarely
          do I wake up and <strong>not</strong> silly talk.

          You know, I think learning emacs is a great thing. You get so many shortcuts in other programs from it!
          Ever heard of <code>Ctrl-n</code> and it's friend <code>Ctrl-p</code>? Ever heard of <code>Ctrl-a</code> and <code>Ctrl-e</code> ?
          All emacs keys. Bless your stars for emacs keys.

          It gives me more motivation to remake my website. I think there's
          a lot of new web design that I've learnt since that quick, long day
          where I just worked with GSAP over and over until my ambition decreased
          and my skill increased and I had garbage, distilled, barely working shadow
          of what I had started to make. And it was glorious.

        <p>
          In blogs you can do some really nice things. Like showing people things with images.
        </p>
        <figure class="fullwidth">
          <img src="img/buffers.png" alt="emacs buffers">

        <p>
          Or maybe in code snippets
          <code>
            <pre>
(car '(1 2 3))
;; Look at that lisp!
            </pre>
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel like I could mix some org-mode and babel magic, some of my own
          elisp, and use of other front-end libraries I could make a really nice blogging platform
          <label for="sn-make-emacs" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>.
          <input type="checkbox" id="sn-make-emacs" class="margin-toggle">
          <span class="sidenote">
            Or I could at least give it a good go, before realizing the project is too ambitious, and settling
            on some vastly inferior thing. Ah, web development.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Although, is it bad that I do all my web-development in VSCode? I feel more
          "with the times" like that. Although maybe one day I'll blog about that...
