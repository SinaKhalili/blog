This section is a ever-updating ever changing collection
of notes. If I'm doing my job right, they'll be super
interconnected like wikipedia. This style of notetaking
will hopefully create an emergent intelligence much
smarter than myself. I am confident this will work
because I read about it on the internet.

So I join the ranks of those super
smart people - the best researchers! Most known
for their great and interconnected notes.

With the exception, of course, of Literally Every Researcher I Know.

Anyways here are the broad categories...

-   Rationality
-   Meditation
-   Hacking

The plan is to make a page accessible from any other page.
