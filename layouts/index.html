    Whoa, didn't think you'd get this far (since this is just a sidebar), but
    now that you're here, let's connect. That's right, I want you to marry me.
    Right here. Right now. This offer is not open to all genders.
    First come first serve. Like ice cream. Well I guess
    there could be some ice cream shops that have reservations. Perhaps even using
    some sort of an app. In fact, maybe that's a startup idea. Don't steal it. Or
    if you do, at least get me an ice cream. We are married after all.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyways since you're here, I thought I might as well share some reviews of
    myself by the people who have the most unbiased view of me, my friends.
  </p>
  <p>
    "I really don't think you should add the wierd sidebar thing if you're
    going to link the page to potential employers" - 5 stars
  </p>
  <p>
    "I didn't give a star rating so stop putting that in the sidebar" - 5 stars
  </p>
  <p>
    "The syllable rhymes are not a personality" - 5 stars 
  </p>
  <p>
    Whoa! Even <em>I'm</em> impressed. I'm also an imp rest (they find my back
    to be the perfect flatness). 
  </p>
  <p>
    üëà Ok back to the regular business. (Let's keep the sidebar stuff between us)
  </p>
